Welcome to Home Credit Default Risk EDA. The data used here was made available on the kaggle website 5 years ago for a competition.Below you can see the competition description:

'Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.

While Home Credit is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions, they're challenging Kagglers to help them unlock the full potential of their data. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.'

This project will be divided into two parts:
1-an exploratory analysis of the data (EDA)
2-development of a model using machine learning tools to solve the problem proposed in the competition

1-Exploratory analysis of the data(EDA)

For this step, I'll answer a few questions:

1-What is the customer's socioeconomic profile?
2-What kind of loans the customers have?
3-What kind of loans the customers previously requested for?(Direct and indirectly from Home Credit)
4-What is the monthly balance of credit card loan customers?
5-What is the amortization profile of credits previously disbursed in Home Credit?
